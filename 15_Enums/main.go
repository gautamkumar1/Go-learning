/*
ðŸ§  What is an Enum?
An enum is a set of named constants.

Example:

Small, Medium, Large (for T-shirt size)

Pending, Approved, Rejected (for status)

Go doesn't have built-in enums like other languages,
but we simulate enums using const and iota.

ðŸš€ What is iota?
iota is a keyword that lets Go automatically count numbers starting from 0.
