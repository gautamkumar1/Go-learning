/*
ðŸ§ƒ What is a Channel?
  - A channel in Go is like a pipe.
  - It lets goroutines send and receive data to each other.

ðŸ“¦ Why use Channels?
  - Channels are used to communicate between goroutines.
  - They help synchronize the execution of goroutines.
  - To sync work between tasks.
  - To send data between goroutines.

There are two types of channels:
 1. Unbuffered channels: These channels block the sender until the receiver is ready to receive the data.
    Means at the time of sending data, it will wait until the receiver is ready to receive the data.
    - This is useful for synchronizing goroutines.
 2. Buffered channels: These channels allow sending data without blocking until the buffer is full.
    Means at the time of sending data, it will not wait until the receiver is ready to receive the data.
    - This is useful for decoupling goroutines.

Note: We can create a channel using the `make` function. and chan keyword.
ðŸ›‘ Important: Channels are Blocking
  - If no one is receiving, send will wait.
  - If no one is sending, receive will wait.

- This is a blocking operation.
- To Get data then we used [<- channel_name]
- To send data then we used [channel_name <- data]
- To create a channel we used [make(chan data_type)]
- To close a channel we used [close(channel_name)]
